TL;DR Is the intersection of liberal arts and technology really exist? Or is art an ultimate sophistication that can be engineered?

Ask this question: What is the best artwork ever? You may argue we should define artwork, better and ever first.

## Artwork:

Consider the following scenario: There're 10000 * 10000 pixels in the blank space. They're enough for any single picture to depict the artwork, comparable to pictures taken from our best DSLRs. The number seems a lot but finite.
The power set of the pixels also has infinite size, which includes all images of that size in the universe. The best and worst artworks included.

## Better:

The problem reduces to how we can determine one art is better than the other.
So if we have an algorithm to determine whether an artwork is better than the other artwork, given enough time, sort all possible artworks by this comparison function, we will have the result of all our best artworks in human history, present and future. Does such algorithm exist? At the end of the day, it is just a function of the neural network in the human brain. Statistically it will have a stable output at one particular time, even given that human brains have flucuation of emotions.

## Ever:

Our taste will most certainly change over time on the long roads of human history because different generations of human beings were living in different worlds, had different cultures and spoke different languages, although biologically we share 99.9 percent of our genes. In a word, the input to construct the neural network is different thus the function is likely as well. In the context of this article, we only care about people at the time being.

Yes, this was on the assumption that human brain is no magically different than a Turing machine.
